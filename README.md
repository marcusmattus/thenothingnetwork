**“Starts with nothing. Becomes everything.”**

The Nothing App is a minimalist, blockchain-native application that begins as a blank screen. With every new user, a glowing node appears—minted as a $NTH token on Avalanche. The app grows, not from features, but from connection. It’s presence, tokenized.

## 🌌 What It Does

- **Zero UI**: The app starts as a black void—nothing appears until a wallet connects.
- **Universal Node Minting**: Each wallet generates a unique node that appears on the canvas and mints a $NTH token.
- **On-Chain Dynamics**: Tokens are minted (+2%) when users join, burned (–1%) when they leave, and sold (–3%) for exit penalties.
- **Self-Expanding Universe**: As more users join, the visual and token network expands—each node connected by sacred geometric edges.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Yarn or npm
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcusmattus/thenothingapp.git
cd thenothingapp
yarn install
yarn dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000 and connect your wallet.

💰 Tokenomics
Mint on Join: +2%

Burn on Leave: –1%

Sell Penalty: –3%

Each action directly affects token value. As users join, the price rises. When they leave or sell, the universe dims.

✨ Visual Concept
The app evolves visually through sacred geometry:

Circle → Triangle → Square → Pentagon → Hexagon → Octagon → Metatron’s Cube

Each slide/state unlocks as more users mint nodes

🧙 Philosophy
“The blank canvas is not empty—it’s full of potential.”

The Nothing App isn’t just minimal—it’s meditative. It rewards presence. Each user builds the universe by simply showing up.
